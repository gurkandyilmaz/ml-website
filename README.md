# website with machine learning models
An Example project: a multi-purpose website containing a blog section and a model section in which machine learning models are served.
This website was built to host some of the Machine Learning and Natural Langugage Processing projects which i implemented while i was learning the frameworks/libraries, and a separate blog page which i may update in the near future.
