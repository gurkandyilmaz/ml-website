# A Simple Django App Containing Machine Learning Models

A multi-purpose web app containing a blog section and a model section in which machine learning models are served.
This website was built to host some of the Machine Learning and Natural Langugage Processing models which i implemented while i was learning the subjects. 
A separate blog page which i may update in the future.
